# TASK-9
This project follows a structured machine learning workflow to detect fraudulent transactions. First, the dataset is loaded and analyzed to understand the class imbalance between fraud and non-fraud cases. Relevant features and the target variable are then separated, while non-informative identifier columns are removed. To preserve the original fraud distribution, the data is split into training and testing sets using stratified sampling. A Logistic Regression model is trained as a baseline for performance comparison, followed by a Random Forest model with 100 estimators to capture complex patterns in the data. Model evaluation focuses on precision, recall, and F1-score rather than accuracy to better reflect performance on the imbalanced dataset. Feature importance from the Random Forest model is analyzed to identify key indicators of fraud. Finally, the Random Forest model’s performance is compared with the baseline model, and the best-performing model is saved using joblib for future deployment
